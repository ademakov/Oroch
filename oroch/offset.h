// If the very first element of the sequence is going to be taken out
// of the sequence and encoded separately defining the origin for the
// rest of the sequence, then the offset has to be applied to it too.
// If the origin is known from the general sequence properties and the
// first element is encoded with the rest, then it could be equal to
// the origin and has to be exempted from the offset application.
